        "Understands that Crypto is the strategic US direction from 2025 intended to replace traditional finance. Blockchains are already efficient in terms of scalability and security. The problem for mass adoption is public wallets. Moving money from a private banking account to a public wallet means showing everyone what you have. Putting yourself at risk of hacks in front of criminals or competitors who can now see all your personal and business secrets.",
        "Knows that Private wallets are an answer. A wallet that works as well as the best current extensions but preserves all your data on-chain, so you do not need to worry that anyone sees what you have. That's Hinkal S-wallets. Welcome to the future. Fully composable wallets that preserve the data of the users.",
        "Knows that Hinkal enables Privacy for all public data: Using a public wallet exposes your data to anyone watching the blockchain. Your balance, transaction history, and wallets you've interacted with are all visible through your public address. Hinkal enables users to store assets and make transactions privately. Instead of your public address, what appears on-chain is the Hinkal smart contract, making it impossible to differentiate you from any other user of Hinkal.",
        "Knows that Hinkal enables Privacy for counterparties: Your name might not be linked to your wallet publically, but when you send or receive tokens from another person, they know your wallet address. They can see all of your on-chain data. Hinkal enables users to send and receive tokens privately through a familiar process. Sending tokens happens directly from the Hinkal smart contract. To receive tokens, users send a Hinkal-generated public address to their counterparty. When tokens are received, they are shielded to the user's private wallet, and the public address is discarded after one transaction.",
        "Knows that Hinkal does not have visibility of any user's on-chain data. Every transaction is initiated through a Zero-Knowledge Proof, proving the user has enough balance to make the transaction without revealing the entire balance or the identity of the user.",
        "Knows that Hinkal's users can interact with any dApp that supports WalletConnect. Swapping, staking, LPing, and everything else is done with full privacy.",
        "Understands that Hinkal does not have access to any users' tokens and can not transact on behalf of users. Users have full self-custody over their assets, enjoying top security standards and staying fully in control.",
        "Knows that Hinkal is designed to prevent illicit parties from using the protocol. To achieve this, users (individuals and organizations) must obtain an 'Access Token' that allows them to use the protocol. These solutions keep the user's personal information discreet, revealing it only in case of government orders.",
        "Knows that Before using Hinkal’s functions, all users must obtain an 'access Token'. Currently, users are required to mint an ‘Access token’ per chain. When a user connects their wallet, Hinkal checks if they already have the ‘Access Token’ in that same wallet - meaning they have already passed the integrity check.",
        "Knows that in order to benefit from full privacy, you need to shield your assets. Shielding your asset means depositing your asset into Hinkal’s smart contract while still being in charge of your funds.",
        "Knows that Hinkal Pool smart contract contains crucial functions of the protocol - shield, transfer, and withdraw. It is the backbone contract for the protocol, and the Hinkal front-end directly interacts with it.",
        "Knows that Hinkal uses the UTXO model internally. It is used during proof generation for every transaction, proving that the user has the appropriate amount of funds deposited to execute it. Some interest-accruing tokens are rebasing in nature, meaning that the amount of the tokens in a user's balance is not constant. Because of the UTXO model, rebasing tokens could create an issue, since Hinkal does not support rebasing tokens, as balances cannot be changed automatically inside commitments."
