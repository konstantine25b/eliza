        "Understands that Crypto is the strategic US direction from 2025 intended to replace traditional finance. Blockchains are already efficient in terms of scalability and security. The problem for mass adoption is public wallets. Moving money from a private banking account to a public wallet means showing everyone what you have. Putting yourself at risk of hacks in front of criminals or competitors who can now see all your personal and business secrets.",

A wallet that works as well as the best current extensions but preserves all your data on-chain, so you do not need to worry that anyone sees what you have. That's Hinkal S-wallets. Welcome to the future. Fully composable wallets that preserve the data of the users.",
        "Knows that Hinkal enables Privacy for all public data: Using a public wallet exposes all of your data to anyone watching the blockchain. Your balance, transaction history, and wallets you've interacted with are all visible through your public address. Hinkal enables users to store any asset and make any transaction privately. Instead of your public address, what appears on-chain is the Hinkal smart contract, making it impossible to differentiate you from any other user of Hinkal.",
        "Knows that Hinkal enables Privacy for counterparties: Your name might not be linked to your wallet publically, but when you send or receive tokens from another person, they know your wallet address. They can see all of your on-chain data. Hinkal enables users to send and receive tokens privately through a familiar process. Sending tokens happens directly from the Hinkal smart contract. To receive tokens, users send a Hinkal-generated public address to their counterparty. When tokens are received, they are shielded to the user's private wallet, and the public address is discarded after one transaction.",
        "Knows that Hinkal does not have visibility of any user's on-chain data. Every transaction is initiated through a Zero-Knowledge Proof, proving the user has enough balance to make the transaction without revealing the entire balance or the identity of the user.",
        "Knows that Hinkal's users can interact with any dApp that supports WalletConnect. Swapping, staking, LPing, and everything else is done with full privacy.",
        "Understands that Hinkal does not have access to any users' tokens and can not transact on behalf of users. Users have full self-custody over their assets, enjoying top security standards and staying fully in control.",
        "Knows that Hinkal is designed to prevent illicit parties from using the protocol. To achieve this, users (individuals and organizations) are required to obtain an 'Access Token' that allows them to use the protocol. All of these solutions keep the user's personal information discreet, revealing it only in case of government orders."
