  "username: @Duck_Chain,\n          bio: \"ü¶ÜThe consumer layer for mass adoption. Empowering Telegram users into crypto through AI, EVM and beyond.\",\n          name: \"DuckChain\",\n          summaryOfOldest: \"DuckChain is a pioneering startup within the blockchain ecosystem, focusing on enhancing the liquidity and user base of the TON blockchain by leveraging Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and Bitcoin's economic security. Their mission is to facilitate mass adoption of the TON blockchain by integrating with other blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, thus creating a more interconnected and liquid environment for users and developers alike.\n\nThe core problem DuckChain addresses is the fragmentation within the blockchain space, where different ecosystems often operate in silos, limiting liquidity and user engagement across platforms. By becoming the first non-Ethereum Orbit Layer 2 (L2) on the TON blockchain, DuckChain aims to bridge these gaps, allowing for seamless user and liquidity migration from EVM and Bitcoin ecosystems into the TON universe. This approach not only enhances interoperability but also reduces transaction costs and increases transaction speeds, addressing key barriers to blockchain adoption.\n\nAmong the notable achievements highlighted in their tweets, DuckChain's integration with Arbitrum to become the first non-Ethereum Orbit Chain is a significant milestone. This strategic move was supported by the Arbitrum DAO, emphasizing community backing and collaborative innovation within the blockchain space. Additionally, DuckChain celebrated the launch of its official website and the introduction of its Telegram bot, which serves as a gateway for users to earn rewards and participate in airdrops, thereby increasing user engagement and community building.\n\nDuckChain's partnership with Nubit, another blockchain innovator, marks a crucial step in expanding its technological capabilities and outreach. Nubit, which has secured substantial funding, brings advanced security and scalability solutions, further enhancing DuckChain's offerings. This partnership is poised to unlock new possibilities in areas such as AI, SocialFi, and GameFi, broadening the scope of DuckChain's influence and application within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nOverall, DuckChain is positioned as a transformative force in the blockchain landscape, focusing on creating a vibrant, interconnected, and user-friendly ecosystem. Its efforts in integrating diverse blockchain technologies and fostering a collaborative community underscore its commitment to driving the mass adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nTweet Reference: 1820816621155631257 - \"DuckChain is integrating with @arbitrum üíô,üß° to become the FIRST Non-Ethereum Orbit Chain in the @ton_blockchain universe! ü¶Üüíé\"\nTweet Reference: 1821189514217587192 - \"Quack-tastic News! ü¶Üüéâ DuckChain's official website is now LIVE! üê•‚ú® Dive into TON‚Äôs first Layer 2: üëâ https://t.co/9cBMWrTRdu\"\nTweet Reference: 1826851631633404379 - \"We are beyond excited to announce our partnership with Nubit @nubit_org! üéâ\"\",\n          summaryOfNewest: \"DuckChain is positioning itself as a transformative force in the adoption of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on integrating AI and blockchain to empower Telegram users in the crypto space.
